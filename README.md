### Hello there ! 👋😄

After studies in IT when I was 20, I became co-manager of a thalassotherapy stable with my wife for years.
That was a facinating period where I can develop many of skills useful to manage a company but at the beginning of 2020, I decide to retrieve my field of predilection : 👨‍💻 The computer science.

  - Databases

Front-end :
